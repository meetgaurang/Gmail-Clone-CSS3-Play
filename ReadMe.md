# Gmail Clone - CSS3/SASS Play
In early days, when I was still a rookie with SASS/CSS3 skill, I decided to do some exercies which upgrades my SASS/CSS3 knowledge considerably.  
So, I decided to create a Gmail replica with help of pure HTML & CSS. Please note it is not an interactive one.  

##How to start developing it
This demo uses SASS framework for CSS manipulation. Instead of directly updating css/style.css, run following command and then update style.scss
	sass --watch sass/style.scss:css/style.css
